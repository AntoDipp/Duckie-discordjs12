# Duckie-discordjs12
An old version of Duckie! Use Discord.js version 12 The old project is completely free to use and does not require credits! You can ask for help by opening tickets

I programmed the bot in Italian; I have not translated any answers or descriptions. Help yourself with the translator

This version of discord.js is obsolete. I recommend you check out my new guide on Discord.js version 13!

## IN CASE OF ERRORS, PLEASE CONTACT A SUPPORT SERVER LIKE DISCORD.JS! You can always ask for help with the issue section but I will rarely get back to you!
